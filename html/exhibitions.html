        <p>Anne Imhof is the artistic voice of a new generation. This autumn, Imhof is invited to take over the Stedelijk's 1,100-square-metre lower-level gallery. Combining art, architecture, light, and a sound composed especially for the occasion, she will transform the space into a labyrinthine total installation. This is Imhofâ€™s first solo in the Netherlands.</p>
